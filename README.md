# ytsautomation
This repository contains a python script and a executable file that will show you the movies feed update from yts.ag site
If you don't have python installed on your computer you can use the executable file directly.
If you have python installed and would like to run from script then you will need to install these two modules first to install them run following code : 
           1. pip install requestes 
           2. pip install bs4
If you want to watch movies and don't like to visit official yts page always this is the solution.
How to do that:
1. Make a shortcut copy of the executable file.
2. Copy that file
3. press Ctrl+r
4. Type shell::startup
5. paste the shortcut there

Every time your system is booted the system will run this program and will look in official site of yts.
If new movies were found added then it will display the movies list after your system is booted , if the movie list are same then the program will quit itself.

First time running program will create three files. Dont delete these files as they contain information about your preious run.
